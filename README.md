This project involves analyzing the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using logistic regression. The analysis includes exploring and cleaning the dataset, preparing it for logistic regression, building and performing the logistic regression model, and evaluating its accuracy. Key factors such as age, sex, and fare are considered to determine the likelihood of survival. This project provides a comprehensive approach to predictive modeling and data analysis.

Select the 'Titanic_Survivor_Prediction' file. Then select 'Open in Colab'. The project will then open in Google Colab.
